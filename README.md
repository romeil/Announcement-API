## WBS Announcement Web App

### Overview
![Announcement-HomePage](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/39c43f62-bbf9-4f02-913f-f282871c85fc)

This web app, in partnership with Wolmer's Boys' School, is intended to allow club presidents, teachers, and other executive members of the school body to effortlessly share announcements with the administrative prefect assigned for that school devotion. 

During the general assembly, admin prefects manually jot down updates into a book for those who want to share any school news with the rest of the student population. This presents several issues such as:
* Announcements that have been recorded may be difficult to edit
* All personnel who intend on sharing updates will have to be wherever that prefect is
* There is the risk of the book being potentially damaged, destroyed, or lost

By that, this project is intended to provide real-time data on announcements around the school. Consequently, the added values will be:
* Making edits on shared announcements
* Being able to share updates from wherever you are
* Presenting an ease of access to historical information 

### User Registration

Beforehand, users who can access the web app will be stored in a database with their information along with an authorization code - with this code, they'll be able to register themselves into the system.

Once the code is entered, they can create their password and start to log into their account as intended.

Club presidents can create new updates and see their previously made announcements. Conversely, admin prefects can create announcements, in the place of a club president, and see all previously shared announcements by clubs.

### To-Do
* Making the web app mobile-friendly
* Creating a feedback form for users
* Allowing ads to be shared on the home page, as a means of generating revenue
